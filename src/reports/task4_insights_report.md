#### Recommendations

- Collect targeted telemetry/support-ticket correlation for top pain points, and run in-app micro-surveys to gather structured feedback.

## KPI summary (per painpoint)

See `reports/data/kpis_by_bank.csv` for per-term KPI results (base_count, recent_count, base_rate, recent_rate, pct_change, sent deltas, flags).

## Ethics and bias considerations

- Reviewers are a self-selecting group and may skew negative or positive.
- Small sample sizes for some terms reduce confidence (these are flagged as 'insufficient_data' in the KPI CSV).
- Linguistic noise (short reviews, non-native phrasing) can cause spurious tokens; we mitigated by using n-grams and stopwords but recommend manual review of top findings.
- Recommendations should be validated against telemetry (crash logs, performance traces) and support tickets before major product decisions.
